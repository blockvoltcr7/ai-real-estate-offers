# Performance
- Implement proper loading and error states for asynchronous operations
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading where appropriate
- Utilize Next.js' built-in performance optimization features

# Security
- Use environment variables for sensitive information and API keys
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use Clerk's CSRF protection features

# Testing
- Use Playwright for end-to-end, integration, and unit testing
- Write unit tests for utility functions and components using Playwright Test
- Implement integration tests for API routes and pages with Playwright
- Utilize Playwright's browser automation for comprehensive end-to-end testing
- Leverage Playwright's built-in assertions and expect library for test assertions
- Implement visual regression testing using Playwright's screenshot comparison features
- Use Playwright's network interception capabilities for mocking API responses in tests

# Code Style
- Use PascalCase for component names
- Use camelCase for functions and variables
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations for consistent code style

# Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments for functions and components
- Keep README.md updated with project setup and run instructions

# Accessibility
- Ensure proper semantic HTML usage
- Implement proper ARIA attributes where necessary
- Ensure keyboard navigation support
- Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines for accessibility

# Responsive Design
- Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS classes
- Test on various screen sizes and devices

# Error Handling
- Implement proper error logging
- Use toast notifications from shadcn/ui for user-facing errors

# PDF Generation
- Use jsPDF library for PDF generation
- Implement proper error handling for PDF generation process

# Git
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Create feature branches for new features or bug fixes
- Regularly pull from main branch to stay updated

# Environment
- Use .env.local for local environment variables
- Do not commit .env files to version control
- Use Vercel's environment variables for production deployments

# Dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies to their latest stable versions
- Be cautious when adding new dependencies, prefer built-in Next.js features when possible

# Performance Monitoring
- Implement Vercel Analytics for performance monitoring
- Regularly review and optimize based on performance metrics from Vercel's dashboard

# shadcn/ui Best Practices
- Use shadcn/ui components as building blocks for UI
- Customize components using the provided configuration options
- Utilize the theming system for consistent styling across the application
- Implement proper form handling using shadcn/ui form components
- Use shadcn/ui's dialog and modal components for improved accessibility

# React Hooks
- Use useState for local state management:
  - Initialize state with appropriate default values
  - Use functional updates for state that depends on previous state
  - Avoid redundant state by deriving values when possible
  - Use the lazy initial state for expensive computations
- Utilize useEffect for side effects:
  - Separate concerns by using multiple useEffect hooks for different functionalities
  - Always return a cleanup function to prevent memory leaks, especially for subscriptions or timers
  - Use the dependency array to control when the effect runs:
    - Include all variables and functions the effect depends on
    - Use [] only when the effect should run once on mount and cleanup on unmount
    - Avoid [] when the effect uses values that might change
  - Use the optional cleanup function to handle unsubscriptions or cancellations
- Optimize performance:
  - Use useMemo for expensive computations
  - Use useCallback for functions passed as props to child components
  - Consider using useReducer for complex state logic
  - Utilize useRef for mutable values that don't require re-renders
- Utilize custom hooks for reusable logic:
  - Extract common stateful logic into custom hooks
  - Follow the "use" naming convention for custom hooks
- Implement context effectively:
  - Use useContext for accessing shared data across components
  - Create custom provider components for complex shared state
- Handle asynchronous operations:
  - Use useEffect for data fetching and subscriptions
  - Consider using libraries like SWR or React Query for advanced data fetching
- Avoid common pitfalls:
  - Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
  - Ensure the order and number of hooks are consistent between renders
  - Use the eslint-plugin-react-hooks to catch mistakes
  - Be cautious with closures in hooks, especially in useEffect and useCallback
- Testing hooks:
  - Use React Testing Library for testing custom hooks
  - Create test components to simulate hook usage in tests


# Callbacks
- Use callbacks effectively:
  - Implement useCallback for functions passed as props to child components
  - Memoize callback functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Ensure the dependency array of useCallback includes all variables the callback depends on
  - Use callbacks for event handlers and functions passed to child components
  - Avoid creating new function instances on every render when possible
  - Consider using useCallback in conjunction with useMemo for optimized performance
  - Be cautious of stale closures when using callbacks, especially in useEffect
  - Use the functional form of setState when the new state depends on the previous state
  - Implement proper error handling within callbacks
  - Test callbacks thoroughly, including edge cases and error scenarios
