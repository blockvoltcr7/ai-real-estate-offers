**Taylor:** Hi Brandon! Just checking in. Do you have any thoughts on the loan amount you’d like to request?

**Brandon:** I was thinking of a loan amount around $280,000.

**Taylor:** That sounds good! And do you have a preferred interest rate in mind?

**Brandon:** Ideally, I’d like to keep it under 5.5%.

**Taylor:** Noted! Lastly, how long would you like the financing contingency period to be?

**Brandon:** I think 21 days should be sufficient.
