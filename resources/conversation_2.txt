**Taylor:** Hi Brandon! Following up on our last conversation, have you thought about the purchase price for the property?

**Brandon:** Yes, I was thinking around $350,000.

**Taylor:** That sounds reasonable. Now, we also need to discuss the earnest money deposit. Typically, this is around 1-2% of the purchase price. 

**Brandon:** I can do $5,000 for the earnest money deposit.

**Taylor:** Great! We should also consider the financing contingency. Do you have a loan type in mind?

**Brandon:** Iâ€™m looking at a conventional loan.
